# ImageLib
A simple and lightweight image gallery for the web.

## What it is
ImageLib is a JavaScript library for creating simple and interactive image galleries on your website. It allows you to display a single image or a full gallery.

## How to use
Include the main JavaScript file in the `<head>` of your HTML document:

```html
<script src="https://pooiod.github.io/imagelib/main.js"></script>
````

Wrap your images inside the `<gallery>` custom element. Enable autoplay with the `autoplay` attribute:

```html
<gallery>
    <img src="/images/image1.webp">
    <img src="/images/image2.png">
    <img src="/images/image3">
</gallery>
```
